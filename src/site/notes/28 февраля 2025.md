## TODO
- [ ] Отметадатить
- [ ] Напомните мне про это на игре:
	Self-help: an investigator may choose to spend time with one entry listed in their backstory which could act as a form of psychological support;
	...
	Each investigator begins the game with one backstory entry that is especially important to them: this is their “key connection”. If the player chooses to use their investigator’s key connection, they are granted a bonus die when making their Sanity roll. In addition to the 1D6 Sanity points gained for a successful Sanity roll, the investigator will recover from any indefinite insanity. If the Sanity roll is failed, that aspect of the investigator’s backstory is revised, and that investigator no longer has a key connection.
